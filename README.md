The time office in busstand the staff are very friendly and answer very gently to the passenger.
And the main thing is to hat's off to the busstand police they have doing there duty wellâœ¨.There are a lot of buses from Krishnagiri and Hogenakal. We used the stand for coimbatore and Hogenakal. It had good connectivity. It's generally crowded and theft is normal so be careful.. there is washroom at the end. Small eateries are good. The guy opposite to entrance sell chips and it's good
